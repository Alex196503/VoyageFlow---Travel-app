## Database schema
Our relational database(made in SQL) follows a relational structure to manage bookings, scheduling, countries, users, ticketing and reviews. The following ERD diagram was designed in Lucidchart to map out the database arhitecture, relationships, and core functionalities before writing any SQL code or setting up the database.
> [!NOTE]
>  All main entities like users, bookings, tours, payments, reviews, etc, will include timestamp fields like **created_at** and **updated_at**, so we can keep track
> of the last tours made, when was the reservation booked, when was the payment processed, having a **TIMESTAMP** data type, to track time accurately across our time
> zone. These attributes were omitted from the initial ERD diagram to maintain visual clarity.
> Due to spatial constraints in the ERD diagram, explicit ENUM status fields (such as 'pending', 'confirmed', or 'cancelled') were omitted from certain tables. However, they are a core architectural component used across the application to cleanly manage transactional lifecycles and states atomically.

## Key relationships:
* A **many-to-many** relationships between users and trips, connected by a junction table, called bookings. It enables users to book multiple trips and trips to have multiple attendees flexibly.
* A **one-to-many** relationship between **Users** and **Tickets**. Each user can open multiple support tickets regarding their bookings or general inquiries.
* A **one-to-many** relationship between **Bookings** and **Payments**. Each booking can have one payment, but the payments table tracks the full transaction history including Stripe payment intent IDs.


## Formal norms & Normalization
* As far as the formal norms go, the **first normal form(1NF)** is respected across the database. For example, while storing multiple trip images as an array within a single column might have seemed convenient, it would have violated 1NF. To maintain atomicity and proper relational integrity, these were refactored into a separate images table with a One-to-Many relationship. The database schema inherently satisfies the **Second Normal Form (2NF)** because all tables utilize a single, atomic primary key (such as a unique id) rather than composite candidate keys, completely eliminating the possibility of partial dependencies.
* The schema deliberately accommodates or highlights transitive dependencies (where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, such as available_seats depending on total_seats, or token expiration linked to a token), which technically creates a deviation from the strict rules of the **Third Normal Form (3NF)** in favor of application performance and caching convenience.
